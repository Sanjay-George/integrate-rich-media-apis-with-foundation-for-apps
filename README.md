Foundation for Apps connects a responsive front-end design framework to the power and flexibility of AngularJS. In this course, you'll learn to build three different apps that connect to major rich-media services: an app that searches and plays YouTube videos, an app that plays audio tracks from SoundCloud, and an app to search and view pictures from Instagram.

## Source Files Description

The source repository contains three completed web applications. Each one demonstrates integration of a rich media API (YouTube, SoundCloud and Instagram) with a Foundation for Apps application.
